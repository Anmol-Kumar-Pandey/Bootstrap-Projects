# Bootstrap-temp
This is a bootstrap template that can be used by you without downloading anything.
# Favicon
The only thing missing here is the favicon for that you must download a proper
image for your webpage icon then type the following command...(can use any type of image.)
```html
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.ico">
```
